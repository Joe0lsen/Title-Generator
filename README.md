# Title Generator
by Joe Olsen

## Overview
This purpose of this webpage is to **generate a title** using random words (of specific types).

This generator takes a random adverb, adjective and noun to create a random title.

These words are obtained from the **faker.js** *Words* module.

I did this project because I had searched the web for a random title generator, but all I could find were name generators and sentence generators. I could never find what I was specifically looking for, so I scratched my own itch.
